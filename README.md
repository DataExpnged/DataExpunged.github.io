# Portfolio

## Learned languages
I only took computer science of two years, so I did not learn many languages, three to be specific:
 - C++
 - html
 - JS

## Previous projects:

### Travel website
The travel website was one of the first projects i made on khan academy, it demonstrates knoledge of color, pictures, and different text sizes in html.

### Animal attack:
This project demonstrated new skill being developped in JS, as it involes object oriented code, and drawing. It also shows skill in animation, considering it involvesmoving objects

### Magic 8-Ball
this project, also in js, shows knowledge in randomly generated values, it uses this to randomly give the answer of the ball

### Build a house
this project is a good demonstration of the understanding of arrays in JS, each and every bit in the house was made using either a 1 dimensional or 2 dimentional array.

### Mountain range
This project is a fair example of perlin noise, it being used to generate a mountain range from few variables, it also involves random generation to create birds that change each time the project is restarted

### Computational creatures
this projects simulates a spider moving in random directs, to show a sort of limited AI, where the code chooses where it wants to move, and moves in that direction, it is also a good demonstration of complicated objects, as the creature has many components

### Summative: asteroids
The summative of the course was a re-creaton for the arcade game "asteroids", the game involves many physics, mainly using acceleration. it is also very abject oriented, involving seperate asteroids, lasers and ship. my part in the project was to code the ship and present that.

## Plans for the future
I never really considered my future with computer science, though I suppose i'd like to contine with the drawing and animation aspect to create animations and images for future employements, solidifying a solid skill for the entertainment industry
